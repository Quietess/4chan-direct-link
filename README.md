# 4chan-direct-link
This allows you to link directly into a 4chan thread as long as the subject field stays the same from thread to thread.

#Differences
##redirect.php
Put this script alone on a page to have it automatically redirect the user to the thread, you can bookmark the link. Use .htaccess's rewrite engine to remove the .php from the end, so it can be just yoursite.com/rsg

##link.php
Use this script to create a link you can press that will redirect the user to the thread.
